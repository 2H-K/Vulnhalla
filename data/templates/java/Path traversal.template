This code uses file operations with user-controlled paths, potentially allowing path traversal attacks.

Key vulnerabilities to check:
1. File paths constructed from user input without validation
2. Missing path normalization or canonicalization
3. Use of File() or Path operations with untrusted data
4. Directory traversal sequences (../, ..\, etc.) not filtered

Common false positives:
- Paths validated against allowlist
- Use of getCanonicalPath() or getRealPath() for normalization
- File operations on sandboxed directories
- Logging or debugging with safe paths

Consider:
- Can an attacker control file path or filename?
- Is there proper path validation (allowlist, normalization)?
- Are traversal sequences properly blocked?
- Is access restricted to safe directories?
- Can the code path be triggered by external input?
