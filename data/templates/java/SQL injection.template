This code constructs SQL queries with user-controlled input, potentially vulnerable to SQL injection.

Key vulnerabilities to check:
1. String concatenation of user input into SQL statements
2. Use of Statement instead of PreparedStatement
3. Missing parameterized queries or proper escaping
4. Dynamic SQL construction with untrusted data

Common false positives:
- Input properly validated or sanitized
- Use of parameterized queries (PreparedStatement)
- SQL queries with hardcoded values
- Logging or debugging with safe data
- Use of ORM frameworks with built-in protection

Consider:
- Can an attacker control SQL query structure?
- Is there proper input validation (allowlist, regex)?
- Are parameterized queries used correctly?
- Is input properly escaped (if not using prepared statements)?
- Can the code path be triggered by external input?

Secure patterns:
- PreparedStatement with setString(), setInt() etc.
- Use of ORM frameworks (Hibernate, JPA)
- Stored procedures with parameters
- Input validation with allowlist
