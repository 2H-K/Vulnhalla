This code uses Runtime.exec() or ProcessBuilder to execute system commands with user-controlled input.

Key vulnerabilities to check:
1. Direct concatenation of user input into command strings
2. Missing input validation or sanitization
3. Use of shell interpreters (cmd.exe, /bin/sh) with untrusted data
4. Command injection through environment variables or file paths

Common false positives:
- Command execution with hardcoded or validated parameters
- Use of allowlist for allowed commands
- Input properly escaped or quoted
- Logging or debugging purposes with safe data

Consider:
- Can an attacker control the command string or arguments?
- Is there proper input validation (allowlist, regex)?
- Are shell metacharacters properly escaped?
- Is the code path reachable from user input?
