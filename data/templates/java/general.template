1. Is this a real security issue that you can exploit?
2. For Java: Check for deserialization vulnerabilities (readObject), SQL injection (Statement vs PreparedStatement), command injection (Runtime.exec), path traversal (File operations), XXE (XML parsing), SSRF (URL connections).
3. Consider the framework context: Spring, Hibernate, Struts, etc. - framework-specific vulnerabilities?
4. Verify if the vulnerable code path is reachable and can be triggered by an attacker.
5. Check for proper input validation, sanitization, and output encoding.
6. Consider reflection usage, dynamic class loading, and JNI calls for potential bypasses.
