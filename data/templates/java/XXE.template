This code uses XML parsing without proper security configuration, potentially vulnerable to XXE attacks.

Key vulnerabilities to check:
1. XML parsers not configured to disable external entities
2. DocumentBuilderFactory or SAXParserFactory with insecure settings
3. Missing setFeature() calls to disable DTD and external entities
4. Use of vulnerable XML parsers (DOM, SAX, StAX, JAXB)

Common false positives:
- Parsers properly configured with secure features
- XML data from trusted sources
- Use of allowlist for XML content
- Internal XML processing with no external access

Consider:
- Is the XML parser configured with secure features?
- Are external entities (DTD, XInclude) disabled?
- Can an attacker control XML input?
- Is the code path reachable from external input?
- Are there proper input validation and sanitization?

Secure configuration examples:
- factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true)
- factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false)
- factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false)
