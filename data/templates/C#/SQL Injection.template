1. Is this a real SQL injection vulnerability that can be exploited?

2. Analyze the SQL query construction:
   - Does the query use string concatenation or interpolation with user input?
   - Is the input directly embedded in the SQL statement without sanitization?
   - Are parameterized queries or stored procedures used instead?

3. Check for security controls:
   - Are SqlParameter objects used to pass parameters?
   - Is there input validation before query construction?
   - Are there ORM frameworks (Entity Framework, Dapper) with proper parameterization?
   - Look for [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] or similar attributes

4. Evaluate exploitability:
   - Can an attacker inject malicious SQL through the tainted parameter?
   - Is the vulnerable endpoint publicly accessible?
   - What type of SQL injection is possible (UNION-based, blind, error-based)?
   - Can sensitive data be extracted or data be modified?

5. Consider false positives:
   - Is the input actually from a trusted source (e.g., configuration, internal service)?
   - Is there proper type casting that prevents injection?
   - Are there additional security layers (WAF, input filtering)?
