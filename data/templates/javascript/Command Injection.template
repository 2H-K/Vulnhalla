1. Is this a real command injection vulnerability?
2. Check if the command string includes user-controlled input (request parameters, form data, environment variables)
3. Verify if the command execution function (exec, spawn, execSync, spawnSync) is actually called with tainted data
4. Consider if input validation or sanitization is applied before command execution
5. Evaluate the impact: Can an attacker execute arbitrary commands on the server?
