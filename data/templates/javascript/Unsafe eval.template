1. Is this a real security vulnerability?
2. Check if eval() or similar function is called with user-controlled input (request parameters, form data, cookies)
3. Verify if input validation or sanitization is applied before eval()
4. Consider the context: Is this in client-side code (browser) or server-side code (Node.js)?
5. Evaluate impact: Can an attacker execute arbitrary JavaScript code?
