1. Focus on the **vulnerable line** - is this really exploitable?
2. Check user input handling, eval(), child_process, prototype pollution.
3. **Context Check (CRITICAL):** - If the file path contains 'assets/','asset/' 'static/', or '/public/', it is likely a client-side static resource.
   - For client-side JS, consider if the "attacker" is just the user themselves (Self-XSS), which usually means it's a False Positive (1007).
   - Prioritize server-side (Node.js) logic over bundled frontend assets.
4. Is the vulnerable code reachable and triggerable by attackers?
5. What data/integrity impact if this vulnerability is exploited?
